  Use when the user runs /next or /leetcode --next. Reads weak-area data to identify the highest-priority pattern, suggests 2-3 suitable LeetCode problems, then hands off to the leetcode skill once the user picks one.

# LeetCode — Next Problem

## Language

Respond entirely in **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)** — all explanations, suggestions, and status messages.

## Standard Pattern Library

The following is the canonical set of algorithm patterns used for coverage tracking (ordered by priority — lower index = higher priority for Explore mode):

1. Two Pointers
2. Binary Search
3. Sliding Window (Variable Size)
4. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
5. DFS (Depth-First Search)
6. Backtracking
7. Stack / Monotonic Stack
8. Heap / Priority Queue
9. Trie
10. Union Find
11. Bit Manipulation
12. Prefix Sum
13. Intervals / Merge Intervals
14. Linked List
15. Binary Tree Traversal
16. Graph Traversal

When checking if a weak-areas pattern "covers" a standard pattern, use fuzzy/concept matching:
- "Hash Table + Heap" and "Heap / Priority Queue" → same concept, counts as known
- "Sliding Window (Fixed Size)" or "Sliding Window (Counting)" or "Sliding Window + Hash Table" → all cover "Sliding Window (Variable Size)"
- "Dynamic Programming (Kadane's)" or "Dynamic Programming (1D DP)" → both are DP variants, do NOT map to any standard pattern above (DP is intentionally omitted from the standard list because it is already tracked separately)

## Steps

### 1. Read state

- Read `.leetcode/performance/weak-areas.md` (note which patterns have been recorded).
- Read `.leetcode/performance/next-history.md`. If missing or empty, treat `call-count` as 0.

### 2. Update counter

- Increment `call-count` by 1.
- Write it back to `.leetcode/performance/next-history.md` in this format:
  ```
  # Next History
  call-count: <N>
  ```

### 3. Identify unseen patterns

Compare all entries in the Standard Pattern Library against weak-areas.md using the fuzzy matching rules above.
Any standard pattern with zero attempts (not covered by any weak-areas entry) is **unseen**.

### 4. Choose mode

| Condition | Mode |
|-----------|------|
| `weak-areas.md` is empty OR missing | **Explore** |
| `call-count % 5 == 0` AND at least one unseen pattern exists | **Explore** |
| Otherwise | **Reinforce** |

**Explore mode**: Pick the highest-priority unseen pattern from the Standard Pattern Library (lowest index number among unseen patterns).

**Reinforce mode**: Sort all weak-areas patterns by struggle rate descending. Break ties by most recently attempted (earlier date = higher priority). Pick the top pattern.

### 5. Announce the pick

**Explore mode** — tell the user (in Traditional Chinese):
> "你還有 X 個從未練過的演算法類型！這次帶你接觸 **<Pattern>**（第 N 次使用 /next）。"

**Reinforce mode** — tell the user (in Traditional Chinese):
> "根據你的練習紀錄，**<Pattern>** 最需要加強（錯誤率：X%，上次練習：<date>）。"

### 6. Suggest problems

Suggest 2–3 well-known LeetCode problems for the chosen pattern. For each, provide:
- Problem number + name
- Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Slug (so the user can construct the URL: `leetcode.com/problems/<slug>/`)
- One-line description of why it represents this pattern well

### 7. Hand off

Once the user provides a URL or picks one of the suggestions, invoke the `leetcode` skill to start the session with `/leetcode <url>`.
